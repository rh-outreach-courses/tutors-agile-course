## Agile Frameworks

Now that we have explored the Agile mindset and principles, let us dive into how Agile frameworks practically implement these ideas. Frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and many more, offer structured approaches to applying Agile in real-world projects. They provide specific practices, roles, and tools and that is it, teams still need to initially embrace the Agile mindset which includes its principles and values. This mindset combined with Agile Frameworks, helps teams deliver value continuously in an environment that embraces change and improvement.

At its core, Agile Frameworks are designed to help teams break down large, complex projects into smaller, manageable tasks, allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation. This approach ensures that work stays aligned with customer needs and business goals, even as those needs evolve by iterating towards better.
