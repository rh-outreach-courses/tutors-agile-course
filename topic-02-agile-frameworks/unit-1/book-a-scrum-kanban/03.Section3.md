# Scrum Artifacts and Events:

### 1. Product Backlog:

The Product Backlog encompasses all the work or features needed for the product, managed by the Product Owner. This backlog is refined and prioritized by the Product Owner, ensuring the team focuses on high-value items based on business needs and customer feedback.

The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list that serves as the single source of work for the Scrum Team. It continuously evolves to reflect what is needed to improve the product.

Items in the Product Backlog that can be completed within a single Sprint are deemed ready for selection during the Sprint Planning event. This level of transparency is typically achieved after refinement activities. Product Backlog refinement involves breaking down and further defining backlog items into smaller, more precise tasks. This ongoing activity includes adding details such as descriptions, order, and size, which often vary with the domain of work.

The Developers who will carry out the work are responsible for estimating the size of these tasks. The Product Owner can influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.

### 1.1. Commitment: Product Goal:

The Product Goal represents the long-term vision that guides the Scrum Team’s efforts, acting as a north star for their work. It defines the desired future state of the product and provides a clear objective for the team to plan and execute against. This goal lives within the Product Backlog, shaping the work that emerges from it.

In essence, the Product Goal is more than just an outcome; it’s the overarching purpose that drives the development process. Whether the product is a service, a software solution, or a physical entity, it serves as the vehicle through which value is delivered to users and stakeholders. A well-defined Product Goal aligns the team around a shared vision and fosters a collective focus on achieving that target.

The Scrum Team works toward fulfilling the Product Goal iteratively, adapting and evolving as needed to meet the changing landscape. Only once the Product Goal is met—or deemed no longer relevant—does the team move on to defining and tackling the next one, ensuring a disciplined approach to delivering value continuously.

### 2. Sprint Planning and the Sprint Backlog

During Sprint Planning, the Product Owner and the Scrum Team come together to define the work for the upcoming Sprint. They collaborate to select the most valuable and high-priority items from the Product Backlog that will help achieve the Sprint Goal. These selected items form the Sprint Backlog, which outlines both the goal of the Sprint (why) and the specific tasks (what) the team commits to completing during the Sprint.

The Sprint Backlog consists of three key elements:

- The Sprint Goal, which gives direction and purpose to the Sprint;
- The set of Product Backlog items chosen for the Sprint, representing what will be done;
- The actionable plan for delivering the Product Increment (how the work will be completed).

The Sprint Backlog is not a static document; it evolves throughout the Sprint. As the Scrum Team progresses and learns more, they update the Sprint Backlog accordingly. This dynamic nature ensures that the team stays aligned on their progress toward the Sprint Goal and can quickly adapt their plan if necessary. The Sprint Backlog is always visible to the entire team and acts as a real-time representation of the work being done.

#### 2.1. Commitment: Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is the single, focused objective that guides the Scrum Team during the Sprint. Created during Sprint Planning, it represents the "why" of Sprint—giving the team a clear purpose and unifying them around a common aim. While the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the developers, it provides flexibility in how the team accomplishes the work.

Even if the scope of work evolves as the Sprint unfolds, the Sprint Goal remains fixed, ensuring that the team's focus and cohesion are maintained. The Sprint Goal fosters collaboration and encourages the team to work together rather than on unrelated tasks. If unexpected challenges arise, the Scrum Team may collaborate with the Product Owner to adjust the work in the Sprint Backlog while still remaining committed to achieving the Sprint Goal.

### 3. Daily Scrum:

The Daily Scrum (or Standup) is a short, focused event that takes place every day during the Sprint. It is timeboxed to 15 minutes and serves as an essential checkpoint for the Scrum Team to synchronize their progress toward achieving the Sprint Goal. The Daily Scrum is led by the developers, who inspect their progress and adapt their plans as needed to ensure alignment with Sprint’s objectives.

The primary purpose of the Daily Scrum is to promote transparency and foster communication within the team. Developers discuss what they accomplished the day before, what they plan to work on next, and any obstacles or blockers they’ve encountered. This open conversation allows the team to make necessary adjustments to their workflow and ensure that everyone is aligned on how they will continue working toward the Sprint Goal.

Although the Daily Scrum is a structured event, the Scrum Team often communicates and collaborates outside of it, making real-time adjustments throughout the day as needed. The Scrum Master plays a facilitative role, ensuring that the event happens and that any impediments raised are addressed promptly to maintain a continuous flow of work.

Ultimately, the Daily Scrum is a critical tool for keeping the team aligned, adaptable, and focused on delivering value within the Sprint.

### 4. Sprint Execution:

During Sprint Execution, the Scrum Team collaborates to turn the work planned during Sprint Planning into a tangible Product Increment. This Increment is a potentially shippable piece of the product that adds value, fulfilling the Definition of Done—a set of quality standards the team has agreed upon.

The Scrum Team—comprising developers—works in a cross-functional, self-managing manner. Each member of the team takes on the necessary tasks to ensure the Increment meets both technical and business expectations. The team's collective focus is on delivering the product features or improvements outlined in the Sprint Backlog, ensuring that each Increment is ready for release by the end of the Sprint, even if it is not immediately shipped.

To provide visibility into the work and ensure transparency, progress is often tracked visually using a task board. This board typically contains columns like:

- To Do: Tasks or backlog items the team plans to work on.
- Doing: Items currently in progress.
- Done: Completed tasks that meet the Definition of Done.

The task board provides a real-time snapshot of the team's workflow, making it easier to identify bottlenecks, monitor progress, and manage workload distribution. This visual representation also helps the team adapt quickly if they encounter challenges or blockers. If necessary, they can adjust priorities, assign tasks differently, or collaborate to resolve issues in real time.

Throughout the Sprint, the team continuously communicates, whether through the Daily Scrum or ad-hoc discussions, ensuring that the work remains aligned with the Sprint Goal. The team remains flexible to changes in the scope of work while maintaining the goal of delivering a usable, high-quality Increment by the end of the Sprint. This collaborative approach ensures that each Sprint moves the product closer to its ultimate Product Goal, delivering incremental value with each iteration.

### 5. Sprint Review & Sprint Retrospective

At the end of each Sprint, the Scrum Team holds two crucial events to evaluate the work completed and plan for future improvements: the Sprint Review and the Sprint Retrospective.

#### 5.1. Sprint Review:

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and gather feedback from stakeholders. The Scrum Team presents the Product Increment—the work completed during the Sprint—and discusses how it contributes to the Product Goal. Stakeholders are invited to participate in a working session where the team showcases the functionality delivered and collaborates on the next steps.

Key elements of the Sprint Review include:

- Stakeholder Feedback: The Scrum Team actively engages with stakeholders, discussing the product's current state, new opportunities, and any potential changes in the market or requirements.
- Product Backlog Updates: Based on the feedback and discussions, the Product Owner may adjust the Product Backlog to reflect new priorities or changes. The team adapts the backlog to ensure it continues delivering value aligned with business needs.
- Future Direction: The Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate to determine the focus for upcoming Sprints, refining the vision for future increments.

The Sprint Review is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint, but shorter Sprints generally require less time. It’s not just a presentation; it’s a collaborative session aimed at aligning the team’s work with stakeholder expectations and ensuring the product's continuous evolution.

#### 5.2. Sprint Retrospective:

The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and serves as the final event of the Sprint. It is a dedicated time for the Scrum Team to reflect on how they worked together during the Sprint and to identify areas for improvement.

Key aspects of the Sprint Retrospective include:

- Reflection on Processes: The team inspects how effectively they collaborated, whether their processes, tools, and interactions were optimal, and how well they adhered to their Definition of Done. They identify what went well, what challenges they faced, and how those challenges were handled.
- Continuous Improvement: The goal is to uncover the most impactful changes the team can make to enhance their effectiveness. These changes are often small but meaningful, such as improving communication or refining workflow processes.
- Actionable Improvements: The team prioritizes the most significant improvements and may even add them to the next Sprint Backlog to ensure they are addressed immediately. The Scrum Team is always striving to increase both the quality of their work and their overall effectiveness.

The Sprint Retrospective is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint, with shorter events for shorter Sprints. By regularly inspecting their own work and implementing improvements, the Scrum Team fosters a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, ensuring they grow stronger with each iteration.

In conclusion, both the Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective are essential to the Scrum framework. The Sprint Review ensures the team stays aligned with stakeholders and market needs, while the Sprint Retrospective focuses on internal processes and continuous team improvement. These events complement each other, driving both product and process refinement.

### 6. Backlog Refinement:

Backlog Refinement is an ongoing activity where the Product Owner and the Scrum Team continuously collaborate to review, update, and prioritize the items in the Product Backlog. Though it is not a formal Scrum event, Backlog Refinement plays a vital role in ensuring that the team is well-prepared for future Sprint Planning sessions.

During refinement, the Scrum Team breaks down larger, more complex backlog items into smaller, actionable tasks, ensuring that each item is clear, well-defined, and prioritized based on its value. This collaborative process allows the Scrum Team to clarify requirements, estimate work, and align on the most valuable features to deliver next. It also ensures that the Product Backlog remains up-to-date and ready for the next Sprint.

By regularly engaging in Backlog Refinement, the team maintains momentum and avoids wasting time in Sprint Planning, as they already have a clear understanding of the upcoming work. This proactive approach enables the team to stay focused on high-priority items and fosters continuous adaptation to changing priorities or market conditions.

Product Increment

A Product Increment is the sum of all completed Product Backlog items that meet the Definition of Done at the end of a Sprint. Each Increment is a valuable, usable piece of the product that adds functionality and moves the team closer to achieving the Product Goal.

The Increment is a key outcome of every Sprint, as it represents the tangible progress the Scrum Team has made toward delivering a shippable product. Multiple Increments can be created during a single Sprint, and each one must be usable and functional, even if it is not yet released to customers.

The Increment is additive, meaning it builds upon previous Increments without breaking any functionality. It remains integrated with the existing product, ensuring that the product continues to work as expected even as new features are added. By the end of each Sprint, the Scrum Team should have a potentially releasable Product Increment, even if the decision is made to delay release for strategic reasons. This ensures that the product remains in a state of readiness for future opportunities or feedback from stakeholders.
