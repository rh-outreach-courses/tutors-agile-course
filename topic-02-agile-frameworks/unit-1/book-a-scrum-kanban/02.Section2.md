## Kanban

Kanban is an Agile framework that focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing flow efficiency. It uses a board to represent work items and their progress through different stages.

### Key Principles:
- **Visualize Work**: Use a Kanban board to track work items.
- **Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**: Set limits to prevent overloading team members.
- **Manage Flow**: Focus on continuous delivery by optimizing the flow of work.
- **Make Process Policies Explicit**: Define clear rules for how work is done.
