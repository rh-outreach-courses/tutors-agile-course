After entering your email, click on "Continue". You might need to fill in additional details such as your name and create a password.


### Verify Your Email:
Check your email for a verification link from Jira. Click on the link to verify your email address.

### Notes:
In a corporate environment, your Jira profile may be pre-configured with enterprise settings and permissions. The basic steps to create and manage your account will still be relevant.
