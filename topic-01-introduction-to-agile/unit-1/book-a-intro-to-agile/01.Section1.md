### What is Agile

Agile is the ability to respond to change, it is a mindset to embrace uncertainty. You are not just focusing on a different way to work but rather focusing on a way to think about working.

Imagine a software development team working on a project to release a new app. During the process, they receive unexpected feedback from users asking for a feature that was not originally planned. Instead of sticking rigidly to the initial plan and ignoring this feedback, the team embraces the Agile mindset. They quickly regroup, discuss how to incorporate the new feature, and adapt their plan accordingly. This way, they are not just following a new method; they are truly thinking agilely, valuing user feedback and responsiveness over a fixed plan.

This mindset was informed by the Agile Manifestoâ€™s values and principles.
