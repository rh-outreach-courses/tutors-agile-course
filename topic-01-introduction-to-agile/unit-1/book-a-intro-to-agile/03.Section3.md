## Agile Mindset

The Agile mindset emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centricity. It encourages teams to deliver small, incremental changes rather than focusing on a large, all-encompassing final product. Key aspects include:

- **Embracing Change**: Being open to change even late in the development process.
- **Customer Collaboration**: Working closely with the customer to understand their needs and deliver value.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly reflecting on processes and improving them.
