## History of Agile

The Agile methodology originated in the software development industry in the early 2000s. It was formalized with the publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001, which outlined core values and principles for software development aimed at improving flexibility and customer satisfaction. The manifesto was created by 17 software developers who were frustrated with traditional project management methods.
